            I am a senior at the University of Iowa pursuing a double major in Finance and Business Analytics with a minor in Spanish. I am originally from Cedar Rapids Iowa, which is not too far from Iowa City. Above is a headshot that I use for my linkedin profile, lets connect! Included is a picture of my family. Below is a table of their names and their relationship to me, I am the eldest of four boys.

                I find myself more happy when I follow a consistent routine for working out. Working out allows me to relieve stress from my mind and push myself. I also look forward to listening to music when I am working out as artists come out with new music every week and I try to keep up. When I work out, I focus more on high intensity workouts with higher reps, doing so allows me to stay fit and cut. I don't like the 'meat head' mentality of bulking up and moving massive weight. Through my experiences, the bigger you get the less mobile you are in athletic situations.

                I predominately listen to Hip-Hop/ Rap and Raggeaton Music. My favorite thing about Hip-Hop rap is the creativity when it comes to making the beats for the track. The steady rhythmn of trap beats and drums allow me to head nod and jam pretty easily. The rhythmn can range from slow and steady to fast and upbeat, perfect for whatever mood I am in. Reggaeton music is very "party" themed which gets me excited to dance and hangout with friends on the weekend.
